# webchat
A small chat based on websockets. It supports broadcast messages and commands.
All users are stored in-memory. The chat does not allow a user if the name is already taken.

Deployed here: http://chat-for-all.herokuapp.com/. The first entry requires more time, because Heroku starts the server.

Here is a preview of this webchat.
